## What else ?

- 🦔 I am currently working on a cute little puzzle game about edgehogs called "Spiky Traveler"
- 🎮 I often usually work with Unity, GameMaker Studio 2 and Unreal engine 5
- 🖌️ I also use blender, photoshop and aceprite to make my art, sometimes
- 🎸 I also enjoy making music ( no plans of me releasing something for the moment but ... who knows )
- 📷 Sometimes I take photos, find them on instagram : [@30lilpics](https://www.instagram.com/30lilpics/)
- ⚠️ If this github page seems empty, it's mainly because github isn't actually a place I actively put code onto, but I will start to do it more and more!
