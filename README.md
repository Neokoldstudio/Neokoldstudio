## Who am I ?

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Neokoldstudio, also ( not ) known as N30 on the internet
- 👀 I'm interested in game developpement :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning gamedev and 3D rendering linked topics, such as gameplay programming and shaders
- ⚠️ If this github page seems empty, it's mainly because github isn't actually a place I actively put code onto, but I will start to do it more and more!
